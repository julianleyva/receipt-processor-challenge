Hello, engineer! My application will listen to port 8080. There are two different JSON formats given in the challenge documentation, so I chose to build around the examples given in /examples, where the field order lists items last, as shown below:

{
    "retailer": "Walgreens",
    "purchaseDate": "2022-01-02",
    "purchaseTime": "08:13",
    "total": "2.65",
    "items": [
        {"shortDescription": "Pepsi - 12-oz", "price": "1.25"},
        {"shortDescription": "Dasani", "price": "1.40"}
    ]
}

Thank you for taking the time to review my application!
